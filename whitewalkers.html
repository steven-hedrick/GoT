                <p>The White Walkers were an ancient race of formerly-human ice creatures who came from the Far North of Westeros. 
                  After remaining hidden for thousands of years, they returned and were sighted by several sworn brothers of the Night's Watch and countless wildlings. 
                  However, most who live south of the Wall believed them to be nothing more than creatures of legend.</p>
                <p>The White Walkers were thousands of years old, coming from the time preceding the Age of Heroes. 
                  Born of powerful and untested magic, they were created to protect the Children of the Forest from the First Men, who had waged war on them ever since they had arrived from Essos. 
                  However, the White Walkers eventually broke free of the Children's control and became the most feared creatures in Westeros, posing a threat to anything living.</p>
                <p>The only known weaknesses that the White Walkers have shown are their vunerability to weapons made of dragonglass or Valyrian steel. Upon being stabbed by dragonglass, a White Walker's body will begin to freeze into ice from the point at which it was stabbed, causing the Walker great pain. 
                  Finally, it will begin to crack and fall apart, as its now icy body shatters until there is nothing left but powder. 
                  Valyrian steel has much the same effect, but works much more rapidly, shattering White Walkers with a single blow. 
                  Valyrian steel is also capable of parrying White Walker weapons, unlike normal steel, which shatters on contact.</p>
